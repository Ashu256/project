        <h1>Hello! <br> I'm Ashish.</h1>
        <p>I'm a India-based product manager, currently building <br> 
            the mobile and web application for a new FinTech <br>
         venture. I gathered my first experience working <br>
          in FinTech, while managing products of several <br>
         startups within the company builder <b>FinLeap</b>. My <br> 
         passion for semantics, analytical correlations and <br> 
         psychological user patterns build the foundation of a <br>
          strongly UX centered approach in product <br>
         management. Before FinLeap I worked as the Head of <br>
          Online Marketing at the agency <b>LOOP.</b>

              for its sophisticated simplicity and thoughtful details. In <b>2012</b>
             I founded my own creative studio to specialize in branding, web and
              print design and to work with ambitious business owners from all over
               the globe. I am passionate about helping my clients bringing their
             brands to life and telling their stories visually. My intention is to capture
              a brand's personality by developing comprehensive and compelling
               brand identities and design.
